    "This naive bayes classifier is quite good at identifying spam messages.\n",
    "The classifier works by treating a message $x$ as an input with $n$ features (where $n$ is the number of words in $x$). Then it performs maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to find the 0/1 label (0=='not spam', 1=='spam') that best represents the message. This is done by finding the $y\\in\\{0,1\\}$ label that maximizes the probability $P(y|x) \\propto P(y)\\Pi_{i=0}^{n}{P(x_i | y)}$. Although, since the product of the liklihood probabilities quickly approach zero, the code above uses log-liklihood: $\\log P(y|x) \\propto \\log P(y)\\Sigma_{i=0}^{n}{\\log P(x_i | y)}$. To calculate the prior $P(y=y')$, we can just determine the number of messages that are labeled $y'$ and divide by the total number of messages. To calculate the liklihood $P(x=x_i|y=y')$, we can use the equation $P(x=x_i|y=y')=\\frac{n_{x_i}}{n_{y'}}$. In this equation, $n_{x_i}$ is the number of times the word $x_i$ appears in messages labeled $y'$, and $n_{y'}$ is the total number of words in messages labeled $y'$. However, words with zero probability are completely ignored, as they have undefined log values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: Rather than keeping track of an entire $N\\times M$ matrix of unique words, as suggested in the hw instructions, I use 3 dictionaries. This may not save much space, but I found it makes the liklihood computation a little simpler once you get to the `model_predict()` function."

    "In this Naive Bayes classifier, we employ laplace smoothing.\n",
    "The classifier works similarly to the previous model, but the liklihood is calculated differently. Instead of ignoring words that did not appear in the training set, these words are given a small likihood (by assuming they appeared once in the training set). The new liklihood equation looks like $P(x=x_i|y=y')=\\frac{n_{x_i}+1}{n_{y'}+N}$. In this equation, $n_{x_i}$ is the number of times the word $x_i$ appears in messages labeled $y'$, $n_{y'}$ is the total number of words in messages labeled $y'$, and $N$ is the total number of features (ie words) appearing in the input message. This approach makes more sense from a theoretical standpoint, since \"ignoring\" words is actually treating them as having a liklihood of $1$. However, for this data set, it appears the laplace smoothing method results in a slightly less accurate classifier. Although, it has better precision and specificity, meaning that the spam classifications are more likely to be correct (than without smoothing)."

    "We originally created an 80-20 stratified test-train split in our data. The code above shows the results of training the model on the full 80% of data, then testing on the remaining 20%. We can see that again the laplace smoothing gives us much better precision and specificity, at a small cost to the recall and accuracy. For this data set, it seems that implementing laplace smoothing makes the model less sensitive to messages that may be \"spam\" messages... but this may be helpful if we don't want our model to create too many false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also test here two models that ignore \"stop words\". These stop words are a corpus of words that appear frequently in the english dictionary. They are also words that do not carry much meaning, such as \"in\", \"an\", \"the\", \"about\", etc.\n",
    "Since stop words do not have much semantic influence on a sentence, they also should not influence whether or not a message is \"spam\". However, we can see that the models that ignore stop words actually perform slightly worse. Again, this probably has to do with our particular data set. It seems that the normal model is able to find some correlation between stop words and spam messages; hence removing stop words hurts our classifier's performance. It might be interesting to try to see which stop words had the highest liklihoods within spam/not-spam messages. There may be a couple stop words in the corpus that actually carry some semantic weight in regards to this classifcation process."
